		<p>Today, I have the honor of speaking with Brady the dog. We talked inside his favorite doggy bed. He kept trying to lick me during the interview.</p>


		<h3> What is your favorite food? Why?</h3>

		<p>Brady's response:</p>

		<h2>“My favorite food is kibble. Specifically beef. I think it is delicious and it smells really good”.</h2>
 
		<h3>What is your favorite music? Why do you like it?</h3>

		<p>Brady's response:</p>

		<h2>“Who let the dogs out by the Baha men. I like it because I am a dog, so the song is about me. Also I love being outside”. </h2>
		

		<h3>What is your favorite vacation place?  Why do you have any specific memories that you can share?</h3>

		<p>Brady's response:</p>

		<h2>“My favorite vacation place is at my friends Tigger's house. Apparently my family won’t let me on a plane, so I stay at Tigger’s house. Once, Tigger ate my kibble and I got mad at him, but we’re still friends. </h2>


		<h3>What is one thing in the world that you would like to accomplish (when you are older?)</h3>

		<p>Brady's response:</p>


		<h2>“I want to live in the bookstore with Bella. Bella seems very nice, and I’d get pet every day by all the St. Markers”</h2>


		<h3>What is one thing in the world that you would like to change?</h3>

		<p>Brady's response:</p>
		
		<h2>“I would change the TV remotes, so they are dog-friendly. It is so hard for me to watch tv, and I want to control what shows I watch”</h2>
 
		


		<h3>What is one thing in the world that makes you most happy?</h3>


		<h2>“The one thing that makes me so happy, is when my brother Brett plays fetch with me. He can throw the ball so far, and I like when he chases me to get the ball”</h2>
